            <h2>Module 1: Understanding the Phishing Threat</h2>

            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>To equip every employee with the skills to instantly recognize, analyze, and safely report a phishing attempt, making them the organization's first line of defense.</p>

            <h3>1. What is Phishing?</h3>
            <p>Phishing is a form of social engineering where an attacker attempts to trick you into clicking a malicious link, downloading a malicious file, or voluntarily giving up sensitive information (like passwords or credit card numbers).</p>
            <p>It is named after the fishing technique: attackers throw out digital "bait" hoping someone "bites."</p>

            <h4>Types of Phishing</h4>
            <div class="table-responsive">
                <table class="types-table" summary="Common phishing types and their descriptions">
                    <thead>
                        <tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>Email Phishing</td><td>Broad, non-targeted attacks sent to millions of people (e.g., a fake prize notification).</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Spear Phishing</td><td>Highly targeted attacks aimed at specific individuals or companies (e.g., an email appearing to come from your CEO or HR department).</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Vishing</td><td>Voice Phishing. Uses phone calls (often automated) to trick users into giving information.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Smishing</td><td>SMS Phishing. Uses text messages to deliver malicious links or numbers to call.</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>

            <h3>2. The Attacker's Playbook: Common Red Flags (TTPs)</h3>
            <p>Phishing emails always follow a pattern designed to bypass your rational thought process. Learn to spot these Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):</p>

            <h4>A. The Pressure Cooker (Urgency & Threat)</h4>
            <p>Attackers thrive on panic. They create a false sense of urgency to make you act before you think.</p>
            <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong> Phrases like "Immediate action required," "Your account will be suspended in 2 hours," or "Final warning before legal action."</p>
            <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Legitimate organizations rarely use threats or unreasonable deadlines to communicate critical technical issues. If it feels urgent, pause and verify.</p>

            <h4>B. The Identity Deception (Sender Spoofing)</h4>
            <p>The "From" name might look familiar (like a colleague or vendor), but the technical details are wrong.</p>
            <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong> The sender's display name is correct (e.g., "Accounting Dept"), but the underlying email address is gibberish, ends in a public domain (@gmail.com), or has a subtle typo (e.g., Micros0ft.com instead of Microsoft.com).</p>
            <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Always check the full email address. On mobile devices, tap the sender's name to reveal the actual address.</p>

            <h4>C. The Hidden Destination (Malicious Links)</h4>
            <p>The text of the link might say "Click here for login portal," but the actual destination is a different, dangerous site.</p>
            <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong> The link text looks like a legitimate domain, but when you hover your cursor over it, the pop-up address displayed at the bottom of the screen is completely different or contains suspicious characters.</p>
            <p><strong>Defense:</strong> NEVER click a link if you haven't checked the destination first. On a touch screen, you can often "long-press" (press and hold) the link to preview the URL without navigating to it.</p>

            <h4>D. The Unprofessional Look</h4>
            <p>Phishing messages are often mass-produced and contain errors.</p>
            <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong> Obvious spelling mistakes, poor grammar, weird formatting, or low-resolution logos.</p>
            <p><strong>Defense:</strong> While professional phishing exists, look for consistent quality. If an email from a major bank looks like it was written quickly, it's likely a scam.</p>

            <h3>3. The Defender's Playbook: Three Actionable Steps</h3>
            <p>If a message is suspicious, follow these three steps in order:</p>
            <h4>Stop and Hover</h4>
            <p>Do NOT click any links or open any attachments.</p>
            <p>Hover your mouse over the sender's name and all links to inspect the true destination and email address.</p>

            <h4>Verify Out-of-Band (The Golden Rule)</h4>
            <p>If the email is requesting an action (like a wire transfer, password change, or urgent file download), you must verify the request using a communication channel separate from the email itself.</p>
            <p>Do this: Call the person or department using a known, pre-saved phone number from the company directory, not a number provided in the suspicious email.</p>

            <h4>Report Immediately</h4>
            <p>Use the official company-provided "Report Phishing" button or follow the internal security procedure.</p>
            <p>Reporting the email allows the security team to investigate and remove the threat from other users' inboxes.</p>

            <h3>Crucial Warning</h3>
            <p>If you accidentally enter your credentials on a malicious page, immediately change your password on the legitimate site and report the incident to the security team without delay.</p>

            <h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Recognize the most common phishing techniques and social-engineering patterns.</li>
                <li>Apply a short, repeatable verification workflow to reduce risk (Stop, Verify, Report).</li>
                <li>Report suspected phishing promptly and provide useful context to the security team.</li>
                <li>Complete a short assessment to demonstrate retention and readiness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Module breakdown</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Module 1</strong>: Understanding phishing: definitions, common types, and attacker TTPs (this page).</li>
                <li><strong>Module 2</strong>: Simulated phishing exercise: a controlled campaign to practice identifying suspicious messages and reporting them safely.</li>
                <li><strong>Module 3</strong>: Incident reporting & follow-up: what the security team needs, how investigations work, and how to recover if credentials are exposed.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Exercises (classroom / self-study)</h3>
            <p>Use these short exercises to reinforce learning. They are designed for a 20–40 minute classroom session or a self-paced lab.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spot the phish:</strong> Review 6 sample emails (mix of benign and malicious). Mark each as safe or suspicious, note the red flags, and submit a short justification.</li>
                <li><strong>Link inspection:</strong> Practice previewing links on desktop and mobile; capture screenshots of the displayed destination and explain why it is suspicious or safe.</li>
                <li><strong>Reporting drill:</strong> Use the company's 'Report Phishing' button (or forward to security) and include the required fields: sender, subject, time, and why you flagged it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructor notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Run simulated phishing campaigns with graduated difficulty and provide immediate, constructive feedback to learners.</li>
                <li>De-brief every exercise by highlighting the most useful red flags and showing the artifacts (headers, URLs, IP lookups) used during analysis.</li>
                <li>Protect learner privacy: when running class-wide simulations, report aggregate results and avoid singling out individuals in public settings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Resources & further reading</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Internal reporting procedure (follow your organization's policy).</li>
                <li>External resources: vendor anti-phishing guidance, common threat intelligence feeds, and basic header analysis tutorials.</li>
